        <p>As a current student in the Software Developer program and also as a current VB/ASP.NET Developer with the Ho-Chunk 
           Nation I have been meticulous in my work for assignments and any projects I have been given the opprotunity to work on.

           HTML5 and CSS3 development for web sites and web applications. As I progress in my education, I am gaining a strong 
           fundamental understanding and experience of multiple programming languages. </p>
